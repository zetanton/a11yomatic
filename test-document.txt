Test PDF for Accessibility Analysis

This is a test document with potential accessibility issues.

Issues that should be detected:
- Missing document title
- No proper heading structure
- No alt text for any images (if we add them)
- Poor color contrast (if we add colors)
- No table headers (if we add tables)

This document is designed to trigger accessibility analysis and test our remediation system.
